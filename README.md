# TerraTalk


## Description
TerraTalk is a social media platform that has a wide range of functionalities for users to interact with one another about the topic of environmentalism. This android app was created using the programming language Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the UI. TerraTalk uses the Firebase Realtime Database using key-value stores. It stores user information securely and allows real time updates needed to allow all users to access the same content.

This application is aimed towards people who want to become more environmentally conscious but don't know where to start. This app provides an easy way to build a community and share ideas with other users. 

## Installation

### 1 Minimum Requirements 
- [Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1)](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- [Android API/SDK](https://apilevels.com/) level 26 and above
- Internet Connection
- Android Software Development Kit (SDK) 1.8 (included when downloading Android Studio)

### 1. Android Studio Configuration
1. Clone the repository to access our project.
2. Download and install [Android Studio Hedgehog](https://developer.android.com/studio).
3. Open Android Studio. 
4. Select menu -> File -> Open. Open your cloned folder, go to code folder and select TerraTalk folder.
4. Wait until all the dependencies are installed. After that is done, project files are loaded.
5. Sync project with Gradle Files. There is a short-cut button on the top app bar, besides the search icon.
6. Set up your emulator or physical Android device to run the application. Android Studio comes with a default emulator already installed. However, we recommend using a physical device as it runs more smoothly, though that depends on the availability of an Android Phone. To set up physical phone, follow steps in section 5.3.2.
7. Run the application with the green play button on the top app bar.

### 3. Setting up physical device
1. Ensure you have a functional Android Phone that supports [Android API/SDK](https://apilevels.com/) level 26 and above; and an USB cable.
2. If your device does not have developer settings turned on, go to Settings > About Device or About Phone > Scroll to Kernel or Build Number and tap on it 7 times.
3. Go back to your device settings and search for “USB debugging” and turn it on.
5. Plug the USB cable into your phone and your machine. A pop up will appear to allow permission for the machine (in this case, Android Studio) to debug apps on your phone. Allow it.
6. After all the steps were completed successfully, the physical phone’s name will appear on the top bar of Android Studio or the Device Manager on the right side bar. Select your phone as the device to run the application on.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.
