##some important information

As our app uses Firebase cloud services, we can't export the database in a dynamic physical file.

A way to access our database is to email us at madalina.triboi2@mail.dcu.ie for access, 

or use the following gmail address we set up that already has access to our Firebase console.

email: firebaseuser7@gmail.com
password: firebase_user1!

Our firebase console link: [https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/terratalk-af20f/overview](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/terratalk-af20f/overview)

To find the database, on the left hand side bar, select Build in Product Categories, and click on Realtime Databse.
